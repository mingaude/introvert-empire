Hello, 

I code with a hope of a career later on in this field since I see great potential in skills like programming and coding. Or at least understanding them. Internet isn't magic.
Here will be some of my first attempts to coding, which are done in accordance with the assignments of a front-end developing course in itmokykla.lt.

Cheers.
Martyna
